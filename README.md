Project created as an assignment for SWENG 421 Software Architecture class during the Spring 2025 semester.

# GUI Graphing System
This C# graphing system allows two simultaneous users to create, revise and display 2D graphs by entering coordinates for vertices and edges. 

## What I learned
- Using multiple Windows Forms to mimic multiple users.
- Using a Singleton class to establish a unique point of control for a collection of objects.
- Using Dictionaries in C# to store objects.
